                <h3>Bull</h3>
                <p>The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or
                    British Bulldog. It is a medium-sized, muscular dog of around 40–55 lb (18–25 kg). They have large
                    heads with thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a relatively flat face with a
                    protruding lower jaw. The breed has significant health issues as a consequence of breeding for its
                    distinctive appearance, including brachycephaly, hip dysplasia, heat sensitivity, and skin
                    infections. </p>

                <h3>Lab</h3>
                <p>Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from St.
                    John's water dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named
                    after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several
                    countries, particularly in the European world.

                <h3>Retriver</h3>
                <p>A retriever is a type of gun dog that retrieves game for a hunter. Generally gun dogs are divided
                    into three major classifications: retrievers, flushing spaniels, and pointing breeds. Retrievers
                    were bred primarily to retrieve birds or other prey and return them to the hunter without damage;
                    retrievers are distinguished in that nonslip retrieval is their primary function. As a result,
                    retriever breeds are bred for soft mouths and a great willingness to please, learn, and obey. </p>
